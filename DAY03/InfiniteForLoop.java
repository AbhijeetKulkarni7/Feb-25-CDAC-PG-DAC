Why does this loop run infinitely?How should the loop control variable be adjusted?

Incorrect Loop Condition:
Unintended Variable Modifications:
Floating-Point Precision Issues:
Forgetting to Update Loop Control Variables:
Concurrency Issues:

How should the loop control variable be adjusted?

for loop :
The loop control variable is typically incremented or decremented in a structured manner
While Loop :
The loop control variable must be explicitly updated inside the loop to avoid an infinite loop.
Do-While Loop: 
The control variable should be modified inside the loop before the condition is checked again.

by Ensureing the loop terminates by updating the control variable appropriately & Prevent infinite loops by ensuring the control variable reaches the stopping condition
