/*

ï‚· Error to Investigate: Why does the default case print after "Value is 2"? How can you prevent
the program from executing the default case?

o/p: 
Value is 2
Value is 3
Default case

explanation : 
The switch statement evaluates value = 2 and finds the matching case 2:.
It executes the statement inside case 2
However, since there is no break; statement, execution continues to case 3 and then to default, printing:
This happens because in Java, when a case is matched, execution continues to subsequent cases unless explicitly stopped by a break statement.
