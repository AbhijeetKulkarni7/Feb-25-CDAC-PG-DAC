ï‚· What is the output of this code? How does operator precedence affect the result?

o/p : 20 

Operator precedence determines the order in which operations are performed within an expression, meaning operators with higher precedence are evaluated first, which can significantly impact the final result of a calculation when multiple operators are present in an expression; essentially, it dictates which operations are done first, potentially leading to different outcomes depending on the order of evaluation.
