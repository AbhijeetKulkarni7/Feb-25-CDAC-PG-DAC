ï‚· What syntax error occurs? How does the missing semicolon affect compilation?


 error: ';' expected

A missing semicolon in most programming languages will typically cause a compilation error, as the compiler interprets the lack of a semicolon as an incomplete statement, making it unable to understand where one line of code ends and the next begins; this results in the code failing to compile and run properly
