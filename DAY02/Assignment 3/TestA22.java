A syntax error occurs when the code violates the rules of the Java language. Common causes include misspelled keywords, incorrect capitalization (Java is case-sensitive), missing semicolons, or mismatched parentheses or braces.
In Java, it is not possible to declare a method directly inside another method. Attempting to do so will result in a compile-time error. Methods must be declared within the class body, not within other methods. However, it is possible to define a local class within a method, which can then have its own methods. In Java 8 and later versions, lambda expressions can be used to achieve similar functionality to nested methods.
