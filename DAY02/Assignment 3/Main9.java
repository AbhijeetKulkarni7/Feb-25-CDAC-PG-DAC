ï‚· What error occurs? Why can't reserved keywords be used as identifiers?

error :  not a statement => int class = 10; 


In Java, reserved keywords are special words that have a predefined meaning in the language. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names, method names, class names) because doing so would create ambiguity and compilation errors.
